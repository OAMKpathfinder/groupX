# Example codes
Here are the examples for the RestApi and React-application.

## RestAPi
The API is made with Express-framework. Note, if this is a real application, I should remove the database.js from the repo, because this is public repo.
My database is a Postgress-database in my localhost.

## React-app
This application works doesn't care what database I am using.

## Security vulnerabilities
As you can see, GitHub is announcing me that I should update my app:
"We found potential security vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
You can see this message because you have been granted access to security alerts for this repository."
